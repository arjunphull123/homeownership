Asthma: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/asthma, https://aafa.org/asthma/asthma-facts/

Asthma is a chronic (long-term) condition that affects the airways in the lungs. The airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the airways can become inflamed and narrowed at times. This makes it harder for air to flow out of your airways when you breathe out.<br>Approximately 25 million people in the U.S. have asthma. This equals about 1 in 13 people. About 20 million U.S. adults age 18 and older have asthma. Asthma rates are highest in Black adults in the U.S.
